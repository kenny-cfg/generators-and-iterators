"""
Create a new CircleSequence class.
It should accept an iterable, which represents our data source
and a number, which tells us how many items should be produced.

For example

c = CircleSequence('xyz', 5)
print(list(c))        # prints x, y, z, x, y

c2 = CircleSequence([1,2], 5)
print(list(c2))        # prints 1,2,1,2,1
